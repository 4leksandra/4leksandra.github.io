<p>This is Alice. She is in grade 3. She loves to color and play with her friends outdoors. Grade 3 is a lot harder than she thought it would be. This year she has way more homework, and her parents signed her up for extra math classes outside of school.</p>

<p>She tried for so long to get good grades and do well in her extra courses, but it is too much for her. Her grades started dropping and Alice has stopped paying attention during class. Instead she tries not to fall asleep because of how overwhelming class has become for her. </p>

<p>One of her favourite teachers, Miss Odette, informs the school counsellor of Alice's drop in grades and mood. This counsellor then asks her into the office. She asks about her home life, about school, and how she is doing. <br><br> Alice reveals everything she is feeling. The counsellor talks to her parents. Her parents sign her out of extra lessons for the time being. <b>Alice also gets a mini kit to take with her everywhere and use when she is feeling stressed.</b></p>
