// Pass Line

// In this game you roll the dice (called the come-out roll) and look at the total. 
// If this total is equal to 7 or 11, then you win the amount of the bet. 
// If the total is equal to 2, 3 or 12, then you lose the bet. 
// Any other total of the dice becomes the "point", and you continue to roll the dice until you either 
// (a) roll the point total again, in which case you win the amount of the bet, or 
// (b) roll a total of 7, in which case you lose the amount of the bet. 
// If the total of the dice is not 7 and not equal to the point, t
// hen you roll again, and continue to roll, until either condition (a) or (b) is met. 
// Once the point has been determined, it does not change for subsequent rolls of the dice.
